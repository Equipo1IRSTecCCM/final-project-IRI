# Implementation of an autonomous mobile robot

This repository includes the source code of our project for the subject: Implementación de Robótica Inteligente from Tecnológico de Monterrey CCM.
This project consists on the implementation of an autonomous Puzzlebot robot, that has to drive through a road, using computer vision and pure pursuit. It also has to be able to detect road signs and traffic lights.

## Explanation

This project uses a Puzzlebot Jetson Edition as its base. It uses ROS to communicate between modules, such as a road sign detection module, a line follower module, a road crossing detector, etc.

All of this code was implemented on Python, with help of the OpenCV library for the computer vision modules.
